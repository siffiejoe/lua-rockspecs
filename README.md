This github repository contains some rockspecs for unmaintained Lua
modules, which have been patched by me to add support for Lua 5.2, or
to fix a showstopping bug.

It is unlikely that the patched modules have been tested on anything
other than a recent linux.

The patch for `slnunicode` is based on [this gist][1].
